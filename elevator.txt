Number of lifts = 2
Multiple requests are handled
The nearest lift is chosen to service each request

Change 1
In the current implementation, each request is stored in the list and it is 
processed one after the other. 
Requirement is to process each request in parallel without waiting for processing
of the current request to be finished
Scenario:
lift 1 is in floor 30, moving towards floor 40 
lift 2 is in floor 10
Now request comes for floor 15
Nearest lift = lift 2
In the current implementation lift 2 starts moving towards floor 15 only 
after lift 1 reaches floor 40. Requirement is lift 2 should start processing 
the request and move towards floor 15 in parallel, without waiting for lift 1 
to finish processing request for floor 40

Change 2
Handle intermediate requests
Requirement to stop the lift to service intermediate requests that come when
the lift is moving
scenario:   lift is moving from floor 0 to floor 10, lift is currently at floor
5, if request comes for floor 8 at this instant, the lift should stop at 
floor 8, wait for some time and then again start moving towards floor 10
            
Change 3
Handle inputs from inside the lift
When the input for any floor comes from inside a particular lift, the input
should be serviced by the same lift and there is no need for selection
of the nearest lift.
The input format should be comma separated values
First value - indicating the floor number
Second value - should be a string containing the name of the lift, inside which 
the input is given 

Change 4
The application also needs to consider the direction of the lift and the 
direction of the request
Scenario: lift 1 is moving from floor 0 to floor 10 and is currently in floor 4
A person makes a request from floor 8 to move downwards. In the current scenario
lift 1 stops at floor 8 and moves upward to floor 10. The requirement is that
lift 1 should continue to floor 10 without stopping at floor 8 since the request
is in the reverse direction

While computing the nearest lift consider only those lifts that are stationary.
Among the lifts which are moving consider the lift which is nearer only if 
it is moving towards the requested floor and the lift direction == request 
direction

input format <floor number>, inside/outside lift, direction

1.
20,outside,UPWARD
after lift passes floor number 12 provide below input
12,outside,UPWARD

2.
30,outside,UPWARD
25,outside,DOWNWARD

3.
lift1 at floor 24 , lift2 at floor 26
provide below input
10,outside,DOWNWARD
60,outside,UPWARD
25,outside,UPWARD




6,outside,UPWARD

4,inside lift1,DOWNWARD
5,outside,DOWNWARD
